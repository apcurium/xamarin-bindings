Integrate Android Pay to reach millions of signed-in Android users and drive higher conversions.\n\n\n\nRequired Android API Levels\n===========================\n\nWe recommend setting your app\u0027s *Target Framework* and *Target Android version* to **Android 5.0 (API Level 21)** or higher in your app project settings.\n\nThis Google Play Service SDK\u0027s requires a *Target Framework* of at least Android 4.1 (API Level 16) to compile.\n\nYou may still set a lower *Minimum Android version* (as low as Android 2.3 - API Level 9) so your app will run on older versions of Android, however you must ensure you do not use any API\u0027s at runtime that are not available on the version of Android your app is running on.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Developers Console Setup\n=================================\n\nMany of the Google Play Services SDK\u0027s require that you create an application inside the [Google Developers Console][1].  Visit the [Google Developers Console][1] to create a project for your application.\n\nOnce you have created a project for your Android app, enable the necessary APIs in the developer console for the Google Play Services APIs you will be using in your app.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredentials\n-----------\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require an *API Key* or an *OAuth 2.0 Client ID* (or both) to be setup to allow your app to make authenticated calls against the API.\n\nIn the Developers Console, in your app\u0027s Project, under the *APIs \u0026 auth* section, go to *Credentials*.\n\n\n\n\n\n### OAuth 2.0 Client ID\n\nThis SDK/API requires an OAuth 2.0 Client ID to be created:\n\n  1. *Add credentials* button and then *OAuth 2.0 client ID*\n  2. Choose *Android* for the Application type.\n  3. [Find your SHA-1 fingerprints][2]\n  4. Enter the SHA-1 fingerprint of your app\u0027s debug keystore\n  5. Enter your android app\u0027s package name as found in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file\n  6. Check *Enable Deep Linking*\n  7. Click *Create*\n  8. Repeat this process with the package name and SHA-1 of the keystore file you will be signing your app\u0027s Release builds with\n\nNOTE: Once you have created the OAuth 2.0 Client ID, you typically do not need to do anything with the generated *Client ID* value since your keystore SHA-1 fingerprints will identify the client id for you.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Manifest \n================\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require specific metadata, attributes, permissions or features to be declared in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file.\n\nThese can be added manually to the *AndroidManifest.xml* file, or merged in through the use of assembly level attributes.\n\n\nThe SDK requires the *Internet* permission(s) to work correctly.  You can have these automatically added to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file by including the following assembly level attributes:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.GetAccounts)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.UseCredentials)]\n```\n\nYou also need to declare metadata in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file to enable the wallet API.  You can do this manually, or using an assembly level attribute like this:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: MetaData (\"com.google.android.gms.wallet.api.enabled\", Value = \"true\" )]\n```\n\nYou must also manually add the following element to your *AndroidManifest.xml*  inside of the `\u003capplication\u003e` `\u003c/application\u003e` tag:\n\n```xml\n\u003creceiver \n    android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.wallet.EnableWalletOptimizationReceiver\"\n    android:exported=\"false\"\u003e\n    \u003cintent-filter\u003e\n        \u003caction android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.wallet.ENABLE_WALLET_OPTIMIZATION\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/intent-filter\u003e\n\u003c/receiver\u003e\n```\n\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Google Play Services SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Google APIs for Android][3] documentation\n\n\nYou can learn more about Google Play Services Wallet by visiting the official [Android Pay SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/android-pay/) documentation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n\n","Hash":"2788971f777a96274779572a39a834ac","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
